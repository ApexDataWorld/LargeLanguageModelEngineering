Title: The Impact of Climate Change on Global Ecosystems

Introduction:
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have accelerated these changes.

Key Impacts:
1. Rising Temperatures: Global temperatures have risen by 1.2Â°C since pre-industrial times.
2. Melting Ice Caps: Arctic sea ice has decreased by 40% in the last 50 years.
3. Biodiversity Loss: Many species are losing their habitats due to changing climates.

Solutions:
- Transition to renewable energy sources.
- Promote afforestation and reforestation.
- Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030.

Conclusion:
Urgent action is required to mitigate the impact of climate change and ensure a sustainable future for coming generations.
